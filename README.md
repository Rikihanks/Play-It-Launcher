# PlayIt Launcher

  

**This app will no longer recieve updates due to the lack of compatibility with some games.
Steam Games compatibility is still functional**

Play it launcher is a sideproject aimed to create a universal game-launcher, built using angular, firebase and electron.

  

## Usage

  

Download this repo and run the electron script located under npm.

Register and log-in to the application.

Right now importing steam's games is working, you can also add you own games, eventhough some may not work propperly.
